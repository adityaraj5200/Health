### 🔹 Sample Daily Split (\~120g protein)

* **100g soya chunks (raw)** → 52g protein (\~₹10)
* **50g peanuts** → 13g protein (\~₹5)
* **100g chana** → 20g protein (\~₹10)
* **50g moong dal** → 12g protein (\~₹6)
* **4 eggs** → 24g protein (\~₹24)

**Total = 121g protein**

### ⚖️ Budget Feasibility

* With **smart bulk buying** (wholesale markets / local mandis), this stays under **₹2000/month**.
* Eggs are the costliest here—if you reduce eggs and increase soya/legumes, cost drops further.
* Milk is optional; not necessary if budget is tight.
