Since you’re **59 kg, 26 years old, 167 cm, male, skinny-fat**, and your goal is **recomposition (build muscle + lose belly fat)**, the diet plan should have:

* **Calories**: \~2000–2100 kcal/day (slight surplus to build muscle, not too much so fat doesn’t increase).
* **Protein**: \~120–130 g/day (2.0–2.2 g/kg bodyweight).
* **Carbs**: \~230–250 g/day (fuel for workouts).
* **Fats**: \~55–60 g/day (hormones + satiety).
* **Fiber**: 25–30 g/day (digestion + satiety).

Here’s a **simple, repeatable diet plan (4 meals/day)** you can start today:

---

### 🥛 Meal 1 (Breakfast) – \~500 kcal

* 300 ml milk (low-fat or toned)
* 1 banana
* 30 g oats
* 20 g peanut butter
* 1 scoop whey protein (if available, else 3 boiled eggs)

*(This makes a high-protein banana-oat shake.)*

---

### 🍚 Meal 2 (Lunch) – \~600 kcal

* 1.5 cups cooked rice (≈ 250 g)
* 1 cup tur dal / moong dal (≈ 200 g cooked)
* 100 g chicken breast / paneer / soy chunks
* 1 cup mixed salad (cucumber, tomato, onion, carrot)

---

### 🥚 Meal 3 (Evening snack) – \~400 kcal

* 2 boiled eggs + 2 egg whites (or 100 g paneer)
* 1 fruit (apple/orange/guava)
* 10–12 almonds or walnuts

---

### 🍲 Meal 4 (Dinner) – \~600 kcal

* 2 medium chapati (whole wheat, \~120 g)
* 150 g chicken/fish/paneer (cooked weight)
* 1 cup sabzi (any vegetable, lightly sautéed)
* 1 small bowl curd

---

### ✅ Notes

* Drink **2.5–3 liters of water** daily.
* If still hungry, add **cucumber/carrots/salad** (low calorie, fills stomach).
* Stick with this plan 80–90% of the time. A **cheat meal once a week** is fine.
* Track progress:

  * If belly fat increases → cut carbs slightly.
  * If weight isn’t increasing → add 200 kcal (extra roti, rice, or shake).

Would you like me to also prepare a **vegetarian-only version** of this plan (just in case some days you want to skip chicken/fish/eggs), or do you want to keep it **mixed non-veg + veg** only?
